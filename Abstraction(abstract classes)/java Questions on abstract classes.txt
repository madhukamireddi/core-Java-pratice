java Questions on abstract classes

1.create a java application where we have one abstract class it contains
two abstract methods having parameters and return type then provide 
functionality for this methods in a concrete class and invoke them by
providing dynamic inputs.

2.create a java application where we have one abstract class it contains
a non-static variable, two undefined methods and two defined methods 
having parameters and return type and a parameterized constructor provide
functionality for the abstract class in separate concrete class and invoke
all the properties by providing dynamic inputs.

3.create a java application where we have one abstract class it contains
one abstract method and a parameterized constructor then  inherit these
class into another abstract class which contains once abstract and one
defined method then invoke this abstract class into a concrete class and
providing functionality for all of these methods and invoke them by 
providing dynamic inputs.

4.create a java application where we have one abstract class it contains
one abstract method then inherit this class into another abstract class
which contains one abstract and one defined method and an parameterized
constructor and we have a separate class which contains one non-static
method and a parameterized constructor then provide functionality for
the abstract class in a separate concrete class and then invoke all of 
these properties under main method of separate class Test.
