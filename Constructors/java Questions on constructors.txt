java Questions on constructors

1.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
default constructor then invoke this constructor under main

2.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
a static variable and a non-static variable and a static m1 having
parameter and return type and a non-static m2 have parameter and 
no return type and a default Constructor then print those global 
variable under Constructor and invoke those under main by providing
dynamic inputs.

3.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
a static variable and a non-static variable and a parameterized
constructor then invoke all of these under main methods by 
providing dynamic inputs.

4.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
2 non-static variables without initialization and then initialize
those variables while creating object and then print those variables
under a non-static method like display

5.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
a default constructor and a single parameterized constructor and
a double parameterized constructor and a triple parameterized
constructor and a non-static variable then invoke default under
single, single under double , double under triple and triple under
main method

6.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
a static variable and a non-static variable and an object parameterized
constructor then print those variable under this constructor and invoke
this constructor under main method by providing dynamic inputs.

7.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
2 instance variables without initialization then initialize these
variables while creating object and then print these variables under
a object parameterized constructor both the default values and user 
given values

8.create a java application where we have a java class it contains
