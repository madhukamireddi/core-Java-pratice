java Questions on inner classes

1.create a java application where we have one class it contains
a private variable and a non-static method and member inner
class which contains one non-static method then invoke all of  
these under main of outer class by providing dynamic inputs.

2.create a java application where we have one class it contains
one private variable and a static and non-static methods inside
there is member inner class which contains one non-static method 
and a member inner class which  a non-static method then invoke
all of these by providing dynamic inputs in a separate class.

3.create a java application where we have one class it contains
a static and a non-static variable and a static block which
displays a user friendly message and it contains a variable
and a an instance block which prints user friendly message
and it contains a variable, and we have another static and 
non-static variable and a parametrized constructor then invoke
all of these by providing dynamic inputs.

4.create a java application where we have one class it contains
a private variable and a non static method and a static inner 
class contains one static and non-static methods then invoke 
all of these under main of outer class.

5.create a java application where we have one class it contains
a non static method and a member inner class which contains two
non-static methods and a static inner class contains which contains
one static and non-static methods then invoke all of these under main 
of separate class Test.

6.create a java application where we have one class it contains
a non-static method inside this method we have a local inner
class which contains one non-static method then invoke these
by providing dynamic inputs.

7.create a java application where we have one class it contains
a static method and a member inner class which contains two
non-static methods and a static inner class which contains
a non-static method and a static method inside this static
method we have a local inner class which contains one non-static
method then invoke all the possible  properties under main 
of separate class Test.

8.create anonymous inner class Example

9.create a java application where we have one java class it contains
a abstract class which contains two abstract methods and a defined 
method and a parameterized constructor and a interface which contains
one abstract method then provide functionality for these by using 
anonymous inner.
