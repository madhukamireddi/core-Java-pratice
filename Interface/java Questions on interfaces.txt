java Questions on interfaces

1.create a java application where we have one interface
which contains two abstract methods then provide functionality
in a separate concrete class and invoke them by providing dynamic
inputs.

2.create a java application where we have one interface it contains
one variable, two abstract methods and two defined methods then 
provide functionality in concrete class and invoke them by providing
dynamic inputs.

3.create a java application where we have one interface it contains
one abstract method and one defined method then inherit this interface
into another interface which contains one abstract and one defined 
method inherit this interface into an abstract class which contains one 
defined and one undefined method and a parameterized constructor then  
provide functionality in concrete class and invoke them by providing
dynamic inputs.

4.create a java application where we have two interface containing one
abstract method and one defined method each and an abstract class 
which contains one abstract method and a class which contains a
parameterized constructor and one static and one non-static method
then provide functionality for the both interfaces and abstract class
in a separate concrete class by inheriting them all at once and invoke
them by providing dynamic inputs.

5.create a java application where we have two interface having one abstract
method each then inherit these two interfaces into an abstract class which
contains one abstract and one defined and a parameterized constructor then
we have another separate class which provides functionality for them and a 
separate class which contains a parameterized constructor and a non-static
method then inherit all these properties under main of separate class Test.
