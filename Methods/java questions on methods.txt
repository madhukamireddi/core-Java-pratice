java questions on methods

1.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
two static variables and two non static variables then print those
variables under main method by providing dynamic inputs 

2.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
one static variable, one non-static variable and another static variable

method by providing dynamic inputs.

3.create a java application where we have a java class it contains

as parameter and returns int type of value and a static method m2 
having float as parameter and returns short then invoke all of the 
properties under main method by providing dynamic inputs

4.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
a non-static method having float as parameter and returns String
type of value and another non-static method m2 having int,boolean
as parameter and return nothing then invoke these methods under main
method by providing dynamic inputs

5.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
a non-static method m1 having long as parameter and returns nothing
and another non-static method m2 having string,float,boolean 
as parameters and returns integer value and a static method m3 having
short as parameter and returns character then invoke these methods
in the main method by providing dynamic inputs 

6.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
a non-static variable and a static method m1 having parameter and
return type and a  non-static method m2 having parameters and return 
type and a static method m3 having parameter and returns nothing then
invoke all of these methods under main method by providing dynamic inputs

7.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
a non-static variable and two static variables and a non-static 
method m1 having parameter and return type and a static method m2 
having parameters and return type and another static method m3 having 
parameter and return type then invoke all of these methods under 
main method by providing dynamic inputs

8.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
two static variables and two non-static variables and two non-static
methods having no parameter and returns nothing then print all of
the global variables in both the methods and invoke these methods under
main method by using two different objects

9.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
a non-static method m1 having float,int as parameters and returns
nothing and a static method m2 having char,String as parameters
and returns String then invoke m1 under m2 and m2 under main methods

10.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
three non-static methods have m1,m2,m3 having parameter and return 
type then invoke m1 under m2, m2 under m3 and m3 under main methods

11.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
a non-static method m1 having parameter & return type and a static
method m2 having parameter & return type and another non-static 
method m3 having parameter and return type then invoke m1 under m2, 
m2 under m3 and m3 under main method

12.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
a static variable and a non-static variable and two non-static
methods having parameters and returns nothing then invoke non-static
methods under static method one each & both the static methods under
main method by providing dynamic inputs

13.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
a non-static method m1 having no parameter & returns Boolean and 
a static method m2 having string as parameter and returns nothing 
then invoke m1 method under main method and m1 returns true then 
invoke m2 method or else print a user friendly message by providing
dynamic inputs

14.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
a non-static method m1 having integer as parameter and returns 
String and another non-static method m2 having String as parameter
and returns Boolean then invoke both the methods under main method
invoke m2 method by passing m1 method return value as parameter by
providing dynamic inputs.

15.create a java application where we have a java class it contains 
a static method m1 having Boolean, long as parameters and returns
short and a non-static method m2 having double as parameter and
returns m1 method return value then invoke these methods under 
main method.

16.create a java application where we have a java class as batch
JavaLearners here user need to enter the details of 5 boys and
5 girls then we have method like display which is of non-static
and it displays the details of students,then if user wants to see
boys data then display boys data or else if user wants to see
girls data then display girls data or else if user want to see both
the data then display both.

17.create a java application where we have one class it contains
2 static and 2 non-static methods having parameters and return
type then invoke these methods under main method and here we don't
store the Object

18.create a java application where we have one class name Maths it 
contains a non-static method add, having 2 integer parameters and
returns the summation of parameters and another non-static method
sub having 2 integer parameters and returns the subtraction of 
the parameters and a static method mul having no parameters and 
returns the multiplication of add and, sub methods return values

19.create a java application where we have one class it contains
a non-static variable and two non-static methods and 2 static
methods having parameters and return type then invoke non-static
methods under static methods one each and invoke static  methods
under main method only by using object reference(new <className>()) 
by providing dynamic inputs.

20.create a java application where we have one class it contains
2 static variables and 2 non-static variables , 2 non-static 
methods and 2 static methods having parameters and return type
then invoke non static methods under static methods one each 
then and print all of the global variables under static methods,
then invoke static methods under main method by providing dynamic
inputs 
Note: only by using object reference(new <className>())

21.create a java application where we have one class it contains
a non-static method having parameter and return type and a
static method m2 having object as parameter and returns nothing
then invoke these methods under main method by providing dynamic
inputs.

22.create a java application where we have one class it contains
a non-static variable and 2 non-static methods having parameters
and return type and a static method having object as parameter and
returns Boolean then invoke those non-static methods & global 
variables under static method & invoke static method under main
by providing dynamic inputs.

23.create a java application where we have one class it contains
static method and call/invoke it and don't write a single line
in the main method 

24.create a java application where we have one class it contains
a non-static method m1 having int as parameter and returns String
and a static method m2 having no parameter and having return
type then invoke these methods under main method without creating or
storing the object directly

25.create a java application where we have one class it contains
all 8 methods then invoke any one of the method under main method
and rest under one another methods by providing dynamic inputs.
