java questions on multithreading

1.create a java application where we need to create an user defined thread and print 1 to 10.

2. create a java application where we need to create 
3 custom defined threads and then print the name of 
those threads along with their priority values and 
check they are in live state or not and that set user
defined name and priorities for those threads then start
them and check whether they are live state or not and
then print the priority values.

3.create a java application where we need to create 
one java custom defined thread and print 1 to 10 by 
using it with a time interval of 1 sec.

4.create a java application where we need to create 
two custom defined threads and then print 1 to 10by 
using first thread , 30 to 40 by using second thread.

5.create a java application where we need to create 
two custom defined threads, this two threads will access 
a non static method m1 which iterates the values from
1 to 20 then print all the three multiples by using first 
and thread and all 4 multiples using second thread.

6.create a java application where we need to create 
three custom defined threads, then print 1 to 20 by 
using 1st Thread, 30 to 20 by using 2nd Thread and 
50 to 60 by using 3rd Thread. Here allow one by one
flow without any interruption.

7.create a java application where we need to create 
2 custom defined Threads, 1 prints the numbers from 
1 to 15 and another Thread prints the numbers from 40
to 50 then keep 2nd Thread in waiting state until 1st
thread print number up to 5 and then resume that Thread
from waiting state to running state.
